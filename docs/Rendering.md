# Rendering

This document explains content generation with the [mojo.js](https://mojojs.org) renderer.

## Concepts

Essentials every mojo.js developer should know.

### Renderer

The renderer is a tiny black box turning stash data into actual responses utilizing multiple template engines and data
encoding modules.

```
{text: 'Hello.'}               -> 200 OK, text/html, 'Hello.'
{json: {x: 3}}                 -> 200 OK, application/json, '{"x":3}'
{text: 'Oops.', status: '410'} -> 410 Gone, text/html, 'Oops.'
```

Views can be automatically detected if enough information is provided by the developer or routes. View names are
expected to follow the `view.format.engine` scheme, with `view` defaulting to `controller/action` or the route name,
`format` defaulting to `html` and `engine` to `ejs`.

```
{controller: 'users', action: 'list'} -> 'users/list.html.ejs'
{view: 'foo', format: 'txt'}          -> 'foo.txt.ejs'
{view: 'foo', engine => 'haml'}       -> 'foo.html.haml'
```

All views should be in the `views` directories of the application, which can be customized with
`app.renderer.viewPaths`.

```js
app.renderer.viewPaths.unshift(app.home.child('more-views').toString());
```

The renderer can be easily extended to support additional template engine with plugins, but more about that later.

### EJS

The default template engine used by mojo.js is [ejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs). It allows the embedding of
JavaScript code right into actual content using a small set of special tags. Templates are compiled to `async`
functions, so you can even use `await`.

```
<% JavaScript code %>
<%= JavaScript expression, replaced with HTML escaped result %>
<%- JavaScript expression, replaced with result %>
<%# Comment, useful for debugging %>
<%% Replaced with "<%", useful for generating templates %>
```

By default the characters `<`, `>`, `&`, `'` and `"` will be escaped in results from JavaScript expressions, to prevent
XSS attacks against your application.

```
<%= 'I ♥ mojo.js!' %>
<%- '<p>I ♥ mojo.js!</p>' %>
```

Whitespace characters around tags can be trimmed.

```
<% Trim following newline -%>
<% Trim following whitespace characters _%>
```

At the beginning of the template, stash values get automatically initialized as normal variables. Additionally there is
also a `stash` variable and the context object is available as `ctx`, giving you full access to request information and
helpers.

```
ctx.stash.name = 'tester';

Hello <%= name %> from <%= ctx.req.ip %>.
```
