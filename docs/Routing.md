# Routing

This document contains a simple and fun introduction to the Mojolicious router and its underlying concepts.

## Concepts

Essentials every [mojo.js](https://mojojs.org) developer should know.

### Dispatcher

The foundation of every web framework is a tiny black box connecting incoming requests with code generating the
appropriate response.

```
GET /user/show/1 -> ctx.render({text: 'Daniel'});
```

This black box is usually called a dispatcher. There are many implementations using different strategies to establish
these connections, but pretty much all are based around mapping the path part of the request URL to some kind of
response generator.

```
/user/show/2 -> ctx.render({text: 'Isabell'});
/user/show/3 -> ctx.render({text: 'Sara'});
/user/show/4 -> ctx.render({text: 'Stefan'});
/user/show/5 -> ctx.render({text: 'Fynn'});
```

While it is very well possible to make all these connections static, it is also rather inefficient. That's why regular
expressions are commonly used to make the dispatch process more dynamic.

```
qr!/user/show/(\d+)! -> ctx.render({text: users[match[1]]});
```

Modern dispatchers have pretty much everything HTTP has to offer at their disposal and can use many more variables than
just the request path, such as request method and headers like `Host`, `User-Agent` and `Accept`.

```
GET /user/show/23 HTTP/1.1
Host: mojolicious.org
User-Agent: Mojolicious (Perl)
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
```

### Routes

While regular expressions are quite powerful they also tend to be unpleasant to look at and are generally overkill for
ordinary path matching.

```
qr!/user/admin/(\d+)! -> ctx.render({text: users[match[1]]);
```

This is where routes come into play, they have been designed from the ground up to represent paths with placeholders.

```
/user/admin/:id -> ctx.render({text: users[id]});
```

The only difference between a static path and the route above is the `:id` placeholder. One or more placeholders can be
anywhere in the route.

```
/user/:role/:id
```

A fundamental concept of the mojo.js router is that extracted placeholder values are turned into an object.

```
/user/admin/23 -> /user/:role/:id -> {role: 'admin', id: 23}
```

This object is basically the center of every mojo.js application, you will learn more about this later on. Internally,
routes get compiled to regular expressions, so you can get the best of both worlds with a little bit of experience.

```
/user/admin/:id -> /(?:^\/user\/admin\/([^\/.]+))/
```

A trailing slash in the path is always optional.

```
/user/admin/23/ -> /user/:role/:id -> {role: 'admin', id: 23}
```

### Reversibility

One more huge advantage routes have over regular expressions is that they are easily reversible, extracted placeholders
can be turned back into a path at any time.

```
/sebastian -> /:name -> {name: 'sebastian'}
{name: 'sebastian'} -> /:name -> /sebastian
```

Every placeholder has a name, even if it's just an empty string.

### Standard Placeholders

Standard placeholders are the simplest form of placeholders, they use a colon prefix and match all characters except
`/` and `.`, similar to the regular expression `([^/.]+)`.

```
/hello              -> /:name/hello -> null
/sebastian/23/hello -> /:name/hello -> null
/sebastian.23/hello -> /:name/hello -> null
/sebastian/hello    -> /:name/hello -> {name: 'sebastian'}
/sebastian23/hello  -> /:name/hello -> {name: 'sebastian23'}
/sebastian 23/hello -> /:name/hello -> {name: 'sebastian 23'}
```

All placeholders can be surrounded by < and > to separate them from the surrounding text.

```
/hello             -> /<:name>hello -> null
/sebastian/23hello -> /<:name>hello -> null
/sebastian.23hello -> /<:name>hello -> null
/sebastianhello    -> /<:name>hello -> {name: 'sebastian'}
/sebastian23hello  -> /<:name>hello -> {name: 'sebastian23'}
/sebastian 23hello -> /<:name>hello -> {name: 'sebastian 23'}
```

The colon prefix is optional for standard placeholders that are surrounded by `<` and `>`.

```
/i♥mojolicious -> /<one>♥<two> -> {one: 'i', two: 'mojolicious'}
```

### Relaxed Placeholders

Relaxed placeholders are just like standard placeholders, but use a hash prefix and match all characters except `/`,
similar to the regular expression `([^/]+)`.

```
/hello              -> /#name/hello -> null
/sebastian/23/hello -> /#name/hello -> null
/sebastian.23/hello -> /#name/hello -> {name: 'sebastian.23'}
/sebastian/hello    -> /#name/hello -> {name: 'sebastian'}
/sebastian23/hello  -> /#name/hello -> {name: 'sebastian23'}
/sebastian 23/hello -> /#name/hello -> {name: 'sebastian 23'}
```

They can be especially useful for manually matching file names with extensions.

```
/music/song.mp3 -> /music/#filename -> {filename: 'song.mp3'}
```

### Wildcard Placeholders

Wildcard placeholders are just like the two types of placeholders above, but use an asterisk prefix and match
absolutely everything, including `/` and `.`, similar to the regular expression `(.+)`.

```
/hello              -> /*name/hello -> null
/sebastian/23/hello -> /*name/hello -> {name: 'sebastian/23'}
/sebastian.23/hello -> /*name/hello -> {name: 'sebastian.23'}
/sebastian/hello    -> /*name/hello -> {name: 'sebastian'}
/sebastian23/hello  -> /*name/hello -> {name: 'sebastian23'}
/sebastian 23/hello -> /*name/hello -> {name: 'sebastian 23'}
```

They can be useful for manually matching entire file paths.

```
/music/rock/song.mp3 -> /music/*filepath -> {filepath: 'rock/song.mp3'}
```
